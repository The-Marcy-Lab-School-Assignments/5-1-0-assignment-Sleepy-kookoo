# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer
Instance methods focus on what each individual member can do or how they are different from each other.

Class methods focus on what the whole group can do together or what makes the group unique as a collective entity.


# Teacher Feedback

Typically yes! This is how they are used! You forgot to answer the first question on creation, how are instance methods/properties created? What about class methods/properties?
